# Tools and Resources for Research Proposal

Below is a curated list of tools and resources related to design and writing a research proposal.  It is largely inspired by the students who are lost in huge ammount of tools and lack of updated list. Feel free to share suggestions. When it comes to software, free and open-source options are preferred to proprietary ones.



## Access to Scientific Publications
SciHub - Another site for gaining access to science papers that are normally behind paywalls.
Public Library of Science (PLOS) - Nonprofit organization that publishes open-access journals and also advocates for openness and tranparency in science.
arXiv - A Cornell-supported site for sharing and discussing early drafts of scientific papers (mostly physics and math).
Directory of Open Access Journals - Over 9000 journals listed.
Investigative Dashboard - A tool for researchers, especially journalists, to share documents and findings

## Bibliography
Reference managers to generate citations, BibTeX, and BibLaTeX files.

- Citation Style Language (CSL) styles - Crowdsourced repository with over 9000 free CSL citation styles and an online editor to create new ones.
